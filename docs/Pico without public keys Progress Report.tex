\section*{Progress Summary}


The project is currently behind schedule by approximately 1 task (2 weeks). The project is currently at the evaluation of core project's speed and power requirements  (Michaelmas vacation).

\section*{Difficulties and Solutions}

The plan underestimated the amount of code touched by integrating the symmetric prover. For example, the planned work did not account for modifying the existing persistence framework, visual (QR) code, messages and pairing classes. Furthermore, the Pico codebase is an ongoing research project with often insufficiently documented code, which made familiarization difficult.  The additional work took up an additional 2-3 weeks. Though the project has slid, the bulk of this challenge has been resolved.

The plan also did not realize the need to modify the Pico Android UI/browser extensions to accommodate the new authentication method, which are time-consuming tasks to do right due to the relatively complex architecture in place. My supervisor and I have agreed that it is not central to the goals of the project, and have implemented simple workarounds that would reduce the amount of UI/browser extension work. These workarounds include: 

\begin{enumerate}

\item Hardcoding the username/password/server/client private key -- these can be communicated out of band, and is a problem already solved by Pico.

\item Simplyifying communication between Pico and the browser, passing information directly via QR code instead.

\end{enumerate}

\section*{Workplan Amendments}

My supervisor and I have agreed that the extension "Credentials revocation" (Lent weeks 6-8) is to be removed from the workplan, as it's not feasible within the current timescale.
